#Case Insensitive searching with PostgreSQL

Earlier today (well, a few minutes ago), I had a requirement to make an
existing LIKE search case-insensitive with PostgreSQL.

Normally this would prove to be messy, by trying dirty tricks such as
downcase-ing content in the search (using UPPER and LOWER) - however,
itâ€™s pretty straightforward.

For instance, the case-sensitive code would be something like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sometable WHERE textfield LIKE '%value%';
```

Whereas, to make it case-insensitive, try a bit of Borat:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sometable WHERE textfield ILIKE '%value%';
```

Alternatively, you can also use a tilde syntax:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sometable WHERE textfield ~ 'value'; -- case-sensitive search
SELECT * FROM sometable WHERE textfield ~* 'value'; -- case-insensitive search
```

Job done.
